# country-state-area-codes
Phone area codes by country, and if in the US, by state and state code.

Use this to match geographic region by phone number.

If the number starts with `+1`, the area code is the first 6 characters, e.g. `+1 555`.
All other area codes (country codes) are all characters before the first space, e.g. `+689`.
